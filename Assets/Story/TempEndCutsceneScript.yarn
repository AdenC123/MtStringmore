Marshmallow: Whoa! Why did it turn dark all of a sudden?
Knitby: I've warned you, Marshmallow, this mountain is a force to be reckoned with.
Marshmallow: Did the total solar eclipse come early?!
Narrator: Hi, this is the game dev team.
Narrator: We're afraid this is the end of the game for now...
Narrator: Thank you for playing, we hope you enjoyed Mt. Stringmore!
Narrator: You'll see more of Marshmallow and Knitby in the summer!
Marshmallow: Knitby, did you hear that?
Knitby_relieved: What shall become of us...
Marshmallow_smile: Oh well, if it's gonna be dark all the time, you can tell me 1000 bedtime stories!
Knitby: Bedtime stories?! We're about to cease to exist!
Narrator: Oops, you weren't supposed to hear that...
