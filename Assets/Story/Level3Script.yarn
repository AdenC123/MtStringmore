Knitby_confused: Marshmallow? Do my senses deceive me, or is that really you?
Marshmallow_smile: The one and only.
Knitby_relieved: But—But—But—I was totally certain that you would keep going anyway, that you'd abandon me down here all alone in the dark. 
Marshmallow_smile: Of course I'd come back for you!

Knitby: Yes. But you must learn to curtail your foolhardy recklessness, because when you do, you endanger not just yourself, but those around you too.
Marshmallow: Yeah. I've learned my lesson, and I'm... sorry you had to get hurt along the way.
Knitby_relieved: Thankfully, I'm not injured, it's just that... my thoughts feel all tangled up.
