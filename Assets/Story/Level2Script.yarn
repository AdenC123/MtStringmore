setting: on the way up the mountain

Knitby_relieved: Whew, that was close! It's getting more and more dangerous up here.
Marshmallow: And we're only just getting started!
Knitby_frown: You don't know the half of it. The steepest cliffs and most treacherous drops are still ahead of us.
Marshmallow_frown: Don't <i>lecture</i> me, Knitby!
// knitby sighs
Knitby: I'm just trying to look out for you, Marshmallow. You need to be more watchful.
// i sorta imagine marshmallow with a "hmpf" expression, like the triumph emoji
Marshmallow: Nope! No hesitation allowed, or we won't make it to the summit.
Knitby: That attitude is going to get you hurt, Marshmallow, or worse!
// knitby is like pleading
Knitby: Look, there's no shame in turning back if it gets too hard. 
Knitby: Promise me you're going to be more careful from here on out?
Marshmallow: C'mon Knitby, it really hasn't been that bad so far.
Marshmallow: Like, what is there to be worried about?
Knitby: What if my grip slips and you fall? What if <i>I</i> fall? What if—
// a determined marshmallow
Marshmallow: Look, Knitby, I'm getting to the top, risks and all.
// knitby, worried about abandonment, holding back tears
Knitby: ... but, with me, right?
Marshmallow: Of course. Now, shall we go?
// a sniffling knitby agrees
Knitby: ... okay.
