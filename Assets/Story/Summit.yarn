Marshmallow: You did a lot of stretching there, are you alright?
Knitby: 
// TODO idk what to put here
Knitby: So, is the summit everything you hoped it would be?
Marshmallow: Everything I hoped for and more.
Knitby: Awwww...
// marshmallow chomps a cloud
Marshmallow: And, you know what?
Knitby: What?
Marshmallow: It really does taste like cotton candy!
Knitby: No way. That's impossible.
// knitby chomps a cloud, and marshmallow snickers
Knitby: I have no idea what you're talking about. That tastes like dusty stale water.
Marshmallow: Ha, got you!
Knitby: Okay, but now you admit that clouds don't taste like cotton candy, right?
// marshmallow chomps another cloud, visibly more hesitantly
Marshmallow: No, it's... delicious...
Marshmallow: Okay, fine, you were right. But it was totally still worth it to come here. I mean, look at that view!  
// dramatic pan upwards to the sunset
Knitby: Yeah. Totally worth it. Thanks for letting me come along.
<<wait 2>>
Knitby: So... how do we get down?
Marshmallow: Uhhh...
