Marshmallow: Hiya Knitby, how's it going?
<<wait_move_finish Knitby>>
Knitby: Hey, good to see you, Marshmallow! It's going well, I'm still reveling in our glorious victory on the football field the other day.   
Marshmallow_smile: Those teddy bears didn't know what hit them! 
Marshmallow: So... can you teach me how to climb Mt. Stringmore? I'm going to the summit!
Knitby_confused: You're speaking of an impossible ascent. Countless adventurers have failed, and the mountain has been quiet ever since.
Knitby_confused: Why would you want to subject yourself to that?
Marshmallow: I could eat a cloud from up there, and I <i>bet</i> it'll be delicious.
Knitby_confused: ... Why would you think that? Clouds are just... water??
Marshmallow: Do you not trust me? Have I ever led you wrong? 
Knitby_frown: Marshmallow, these peaks have claimed many adventurers before you. Just because you have a chip on your shoulder—
Marshmallow_frown: I have a <i>what</i> on my shoulder?
Knitby_relieved: Let me rephrase. Just because you want to prove yourself doesn't mean you should recklessly endanger yourself—
Marshmallow: <i>Blah blah blah</i>, I can't hear you!
