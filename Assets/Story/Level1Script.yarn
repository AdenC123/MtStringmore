Marshmallow: Hiya Knitby, how's it going?
Knitby: Hey, good to see you, Marshmallow! It's going well, I'm still reveling in our glorious victory on the football field the other day.  
Marshmallow: <i>*smiling*</i> Those teddy bears didn't know what hit them! 
Marshmallow: So... Can you teach me how to climb Mt. Stringmore? I'm going to the summit!
Knitby: It's a really treacherous journey to get up there, why would you want to subject yourself to that?
Marshmallow: I could eat a cloud from up there, and I <i>bet</i> it'll be delicious.
Knitby: ... Why would you think that? Clouds are just... water??
Marshmallow: Do you not trust me? Have I ever led you wrong?
Knitby: <i>*sternly*</i> Marshmallow, these peaks have claimed many adventurers before you. Just because you have a chip on your shoulder—
Marshmallow: I have a <i>what</i> on my shoulder?
Knitby: Let me rephrase. Just because you want to prove yourself doesn't mean you should recklessly endanger yourself—
Marshmallow: Well, okay then. Bye! <i>*takes off at a full sprint*</i>

Knitby: Wait, where are you going in such a hurry?
Marshmallow: <i>*getting further away*</i> Up the mountain, duh!
Knitby: <i>*shouting*</i> But why?
Marshmallow: <i>*far away*</i> Because I know you can't help but follow me anyway!
Knitby: <i>*sighs*</i> ...
<<run Knitby 44 1 20>>
Knitby: <i>*shouting*</i> Fine, I'm coming, wait up!
Marshmallow: <i>*playfully*</i> Good, try to keep up!
